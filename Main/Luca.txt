What do you wish you knew at the beginning of the year? 

I wish I had known at the beginning of the year how much I had to focus on the language. In regular Comp Sci., it's easier to know the language, whereas with CAS and using XCode, there are a lot more commands and words you need to know to understand what you're coding.
